## About-Me-Webpage

My About Me webpage was a project that the task was to build a responsive website using the Bootstrap container method and plug-ins.

## Motivation

My motivation for this project was to challenge myself as a new student developer. While there were many obstacles along the way, I took great enjoyment in overcoming those challenges.
